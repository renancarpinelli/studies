    <string name="text1">Alan Mathison Turing OBE (June 23, 1912 - June 7, 1954) was a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist. He was influential in the development of computer science and in the formalization of the concept of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, playing an important role in the creation of the modern computer. [1] [2] [3] He is also a pioneer in artificial intelligence and computer science. [4] He is known as the father of computing.</string>
    <string name="text2">" Born in Wisconsin, he graduated in 1960. In 1963 he earned a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) where he became a teacher and began working on The Art of Computer Programming originally planned as a series of seven books . The first volume was published in 1968. In that same year he moved to Stanford University. In 1974 he won the Turing Prize.  In 1976, after producing the third volume of his series, he became so frustrated with the old-fashioned state of publishing tools that he devoted his time to creating something better. From their efforts came the tools TEX and METAFONT.  In recognition of his contributions to computer science he was awarded in 1990 with the unique title of Professor of the Art of Computer Programming, which was later upgraded to Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming.  In 1992 he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences. That same year he retired from university to complete The Art of Computer Programming. In 2003 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2004 the first three volumes of his book were reissued. Knuth is currently working on fourth volume and excerpts are periodically released on his personal website."</string>
